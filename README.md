# UnicalDown v1.2

### Changelog

#### v1.1
 - Ehanced stuff for unstable connection

#### v1.2

## PREREQS

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/it/download/): anything above v8.0 seems to work.
* [**aria2**](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases): this needs to be in your `$PATH` (for example, copy aria2c.exe to C:\Windows). UnicalDown calls `aria2c` with a bunch of arguments in order to improve the download speed.
* [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): a recent version (year 2019 or above), in [`$PATH`](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10). On Windows, the [nightly build](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-20200309-608b8a8-win64-static.zip) is recommended.
* A stable connection is recommended. Video fragments acquiring is a timed procedure due to Stream m3u8 source.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
### Windows
Videoguide provided by original PoliDown project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZgea4t5YW4. Just intending "UnicalDown" or "unicaldown" instead of "PoliDown" or "polidown". **After finishing the installation successfully, reboot to avoid any headless chromium booting issue**.
### Other OSs
Installation is pretty much the same.

## Double-clickable script launcher (Windows only)
An executable .bat file is provided. Just double-click on to automatically open cmd and start downloading.
*Before to go*, right-click on it and choose Edit option. Just properly insert the usage that you want and Save next.

## Default usage
```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1"

$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -f urlsFile.txt

```
You can omit the password argument. UnicalDown will ask for it interactively and then save it securely in local system's keychain for the next use.

```
$ node unicaldown.js -h

```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode
    -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1"

$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -f path/to/video/urlsFile.txt
```
You can create a .txt file containing video URLs, **one URL for each line**. The text file can have any name, only be sure that it is followed by .txt extension. Absolute path is not necessary if the .txt file is located in the unicaldown.js directory.

```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -q 4
```

#### Output directory (relative or absoulte path):
```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -o "/my/path/here"
```

#### Do not use system keyring to save the password:
```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -k
```
