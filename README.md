## PREREQS

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/it/download/): anything above v8.0 seems to work.
* [**aria2**](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases): this needs to be in your `$PATH` (for example, copy aria2c.exe to C:\Windows). UnicalDown calls `aria2c` with a bunch of arguments in order to improve the download speed.
* [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): a recent version (year 2019 or above), in [`$PATH`](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10). On Windows, the [nightly build](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/win64/static/ffmpeg-20200309-608b8a8-win64-static.zip) is recommended.
* A stable connection is recommended. Video fragments acquiring is a timed procedure due to Stream m3u8 source.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
### Windows
Videoguide provided by original PoliDown project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZgea4t5YW4. Just intending "UnicalDown" or "unicaldown" instead of "PoliDown" or "polidown". **After finishing the installation successfully, reboot to avoid any headless chromium booting issue**.
### Other OSs
Installation is pretty much the same.

## Double-clickable script launcher (Windows only)
An executable .bat file is provided. Just double-click on to automatically open cmd and start downloading.
*Before to go*, right-click on it and choose Edit option. Just properly insert the usage that you want and Save next.
### *Coffee version*
Coffee is a portable .exe from https://sourceforge.net/projects/coffee-sc/ open source project. It provides to prevent PC standby when downloading. *Coffee version* just starts and also kills Coffee task after UnicalDown procedure is finished. In case of "illegal" killing problems (e.g. cmd was prematurely closed), you can exit from Coffee by right-clicking on its properly icon in notification area.

## Default usage
```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1"

$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -f urlsFile.txt

```
You can omit the password argument. UnicalDown will ask for it interactively and then save it securely in local system's keychain for the next use.

$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -o "/my/path/here"
```

```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -k
```
