### Disclaimer
Hopefully this doesn't break the end user agreement for Microsoft Stream. Since we're simply saving the HLS stream to disk as if we were a browser, this does not abuse the streaming endpoints. However I take no responsibility if either Microsoft or your Office 365 admins request a chat with you in a small white room.

### Important notes
- Script does not provided yet an effective way to refresh the access token i.e. cookies. So the execution stops on valid URLs also from a certain point onwards, if script runs for one hour or so (seems such a strict max-age session cookies. Damn Microsoft.). Any suggestions (especially) about are accepted.
- Starting from [v1.5](https://github.com/peppelongo96/UnicalDown#v15), [node-notifier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier) module is added to enable (by default) a system of native notification for terminated downloading process. For this and to avoid any not expected bug, *if you are upgrading*, you need a clean installation or to just update dependencies by `$ npm install` command.
 
## PREREQS
* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/it/download/): anything above v8.0 seems to work.
* [**aria2**](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases): this needs to be in your `$PATH`. Choose the latest release.
* [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): a recent version (year 2019 or above), always in your `$PATH`. On Windows, a nightly build (i.e. Git version) is recommended.
* A stable connection is recommended. Video fragments acquiring is a timed procedure due to Stream m3u8 source.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
### Windows
Videoguide provided by original PoliDown project: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZgea4t5YW4. Just intending "UnicalDown" or "unicaldown" instead of "PoliDown" or "polidown". **After finishing the installation successfully, reboot to avoid any headless chromium booting issue**.
### macOS/Linux
Installation is pretty much the same.

## EASY-LAUNCHER
Executable .sh and .bat file are provided for a simpler script usage. *Before to go*, **it's necessary to configure them**. *In general*, right-click on file and choose some Edit option.
### for Windows 
An executable .bat file is provided. After properly settled it, just double-click on to automatically open cmd and start downloading.
#### *Coffee version*
Coffee is a portable .exe from https://sourceforge.net/projects/coffee-sc/ open source project. It provides to prevent PC standby when downloading. *Coffee version* just starts and also kills Coffee task after UnicalDown procedure is finished. In case of "illegal" killing problems (e.g. cmd was prematurely closed), you can exit from Coffee by right-clicking on its properly icon in notification area.
### for macOS/Linux
An executable .sh file is provided. **It's necessary to make it runnable**: execute `chmod 777 this_launcher.sh` on terminal (obviously, you must navigate to project folder before). Next, **always run** the .sh script **using terminal**.

## Default usage
```
$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1"

$ node unicaldown.js -u fiscalcode -f urlsFile.txt
